Great job on your resume! Regarding to the timeline of your experience, have you considered adding year in it? I would suggest giving it the same format consistently like 'April 2021 - July 2021' throughout the whole resume. It makes it more readable. 

I noticed that some of your sentences started with nouns. I would highly recommend using strong verbs to start a sentence while writing a resume. That makes the resume look more powerful. For example, instead of 'An ability to manage groups of pupils..' , use 'Managed group of pupils...'. 

I like that you specify the number of hours you work per day under the 'Dazhong Real Estate' job section. Numbers make your resume more noticeable. Quantify as often as possible. This shows employers what you have accomplished at work.
